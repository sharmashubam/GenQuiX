## Introduction

This app provides quizzes with questions generated by AI. The frontend is built with Next.js, while the backend utilizes FastAPI to handle requests and generate quiz questions. Alembic and SQLAlchemy are used for database migrations and ORM, respectively. The entire application is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, with PostgreSQL as the database. The backend is uploaded to [https://github.com/sharmashubam/GenQuiX-backend](https://github.com/sharmashubam/GenQuiX-backend).
